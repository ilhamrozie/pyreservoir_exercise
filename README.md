# pyreservoir_exercise

This repository archived my assignments from participating in a SPE organized event called Automating Reservoir Engineering and Geoscience. This repository could not have been made without the helpful guidance of Mr. Yohanes Nuwara, the author of pyreservoir module. Feel free to check him out on github : yohanesnuwara.

This repository demonstrated the multi usage of pyreservoir module for well logging and pressure transient analysis.
